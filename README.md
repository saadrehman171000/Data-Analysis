# Data Analysis Projects

This repository contains the results of three data analysis projects: Sales Data Analysis, Diabetes Patients Analysis, and HR Analytics.

## Sales Data Analysis

### Purpose
The Sales Data Analysis project aims to uncover trends, identify top-selling products, and analyze revenue metrics to facilitate business decision-making.

### Description
In this project, we explored a large sales dataset, examining sales trends over time, identifying best-selling products, and calculating revenue metrics such as total sales and profit margins. Through visualizations, we presented our findings effectively, showcasing our ability to derive insights from large datasets and make data-driven recommendations for optimizing sales strategies.

## Diabetes Patients Analysis

### About Dataset
The Diabetes Patients Analysis project utilizes a dataset originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. It aims to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on certain diagnostic measurements. The dataset includes several independent medical predictor variables and one target dependent variable (Outcome).

### Description
We performed predictive analysis using the dataset, exploring diagnostic measurements to predict diabetes in patients. Through data analysis techniques, we derived insights to aid in diagnostic prediction.

## HR Analytics

### Tasks Completed
- Deleted redundant columns
- Renamed columns
- Dropped duplicates
- Cleaned individual columns
- Removed NaN values from the dataset
- Checked for additional transformations
- Visualized various aspects of HR data

### Data Visualization
- Correlation map for all numeric variables
- Analysis of Overtime, Marital Status, Job Role, Gender, Education Field, Department, and Business Travel
- Relation between Overtime and Age
- Analysis of Total Working Years, Education Level, Number of Companies Worked, and Distance from Home

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.
